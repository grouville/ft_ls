# ft_ls
The first project of the system branch.

The aim ? To accurately reproduce the ls command.

Through this project, I learned to comply with the POSIX standard and to use recursivity in order to manage the  "-R" flag (recursive search inside folders).

My current implementation supports the -l,  -R, -a, -r and -t
options.
